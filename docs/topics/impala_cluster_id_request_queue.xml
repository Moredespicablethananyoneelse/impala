    <title>Overview</title>
    <conbody>
      <p rev="4.5.0">Starting with <ph keyref="impala45"/>, you can add a cluster ID to the
        membership and request-queue topic names. This feature enables sharing a single Catalogd and
        Statestore service across multiple Impala clusters while ensuring that queries are scheduled
        only within the same cluster.</p>

    <concept id="ss_topics">
      <title>How Impala Uses Statestore Topics</title>
      <conbody>
        <p>Coordinators subscribe to three statestore topics:<ul id="ul_ff5_knm_p2c">
            <li><codeph>catalog-update</codeph></li>
            <li><codeph>impala-membership</codeph></li>
            <li><codeph>impala-request-queue</codeph></li>
          </ul></p>
        <p>The two topics <codeph>impala-membership</codeph> and
            <codeph>impala-request-queue</codeph> are used for query scheduling. By adding a cluster
          ID to these topic names, Impala daemons (Impalads) are only visible to each other inside
          the same cluster. Queries are not scheduled across different clusters. However, all Impala
          daemons still subscribe to the same <codeph>catalog-update</codeph> topic, allowing them
          to share the same Catalog service.<note id="note_lxv_4nm_p2c" type="note">If the cluster
            ID is empty, the original topic names are used.</note></p>

      <title>Starting a New Cluster with an Existing Catalogd and Statestore</title>
      <conbody>
        <p>To start a new cluster using an existing Catalogd and statestore, set the
            <codeph>--cluster_membership_topic_id=new_cluster_name</codeph> flag in the coordinator,
          executor, and admission daemon of the new cluster. The other flags can remain the same as
          in existing clusters.</p>
